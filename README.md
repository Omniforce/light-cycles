# Lightcycles

Multiplayer game based on the [Light cycles battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BZxGhNdz1k) from Tron. Each player controls a car as it moves around the board. As cars move, they leave behind walls. Hitting either the edges of the board or the walls generated by cars will knock you out of the round. The goal is to survive longer than all of the other players!

Build with React/Redux and primarily runs on a simple Websocket server to keep all clients up to date. Up to four people can play at a time, but any number of people can watch the games.

## How to run locally

**You must start both the client and server.**

#### Starting the websocket server
1. From the root, navigate into `server/`
2. Install all dependencies using `npm install`
3. Build and start server using `npm start`

#### Starting the client server
1. Keeping the websocket server running, navigate to the `client/` directory
2. Install all dependencies using either `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Run server using either `yarn start` or `npm start`.
4. Open [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) in your preferred browser to play!

Working on building a simple AI at the moment, but as this is not yet complete, you must have atleast one other person to play. You can open this app again in a second tab to simulate the second player.
